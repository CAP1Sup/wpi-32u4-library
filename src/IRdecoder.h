/*
 * A class to interpret IR remotes with NEC encoding. NEC encoding sends four bytes:
 * 
 * [device ID, ~divice ID, key code, ~key code]
 * 
 * Sending the inverse allow for easy error checking (and reduces saturation in the receiver).
 * 
 * Codes are send in little endian; this library reverses upon reception, so the first bit received
 * is in the LSB of currCode. That means that the key code is found in bits [23..16] of currCode
 * 
 * https://techdocs.altium.com/display/FPGA/NEC+Infrared+Transmission+Protocol
 * 
 * This does not interpret the codes into which key was pressed. That needs to be 
 * mapped on a remote by remote basis.
