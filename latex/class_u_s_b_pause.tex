\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This class disables USB interrupts in its constructor when it is created and restores them to their previous state in its destructor when it is destroyed. This class is tailored to the behavior of the Arduino core USB code, so it might have to change if that code changes.

This class assumes that the only USB interrupts enabled are general device interrupts and endpoint 0 interrupts.

It also assumes that the endpoint 0 interrupts will not enable or disable any of the general device interrupts. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
